# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues
- Switched from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Updated `404.html` for proper redirects
- URLs will now use hash routing (e.g., `yoursite.github.io/#/about`)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Build Your Project
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `build` folder with all production files.

### 2. Install gh-pages (if not installed)
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

### 3. Update package.json
Add these scripts and homepage:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your repository name (e.g., `trackpulse-logistics`)

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your project
- Create a `gh-pages` branch
- Push the build folder to GitHub Pages

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Select **gh-pages** branch
5. Select **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### 6. Access Your Site
Your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME
```

## Important Notes

### Hash Routing
- URLs will use `#` (e.g., `yoursite.github.io/#/about`)
- This is required for GitHub Pages to work with React Router
- All navigation will work correctly

### After Deployment
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
- Check that all routes work: `/#/`, `/#/about`, `/#/services`, etc.

## Alternative: Using GitHub Actions (Advanced)

If you prefer clean URLs without `#`, you can use GitHub Actions to deploy, but HashRouter is simpler and works immediately.

## Troubleshooting

**"File not found" error:**
- Make sure you ran `npm run deploy`
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the `gh-pages` branch exists
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub to update

**Routes not working:**
- Make sure you're using HashRouter (already fixed)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
